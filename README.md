Xtra Script
===========

Xtra Scripts contains scripts for automate daily tasks.

## Requirements

It requires:
* a _bash_ interpreter
* some external command line tools: _grep_, _sed_, _which_, _sort_, _uniq_
It's recommended to use it inside a Linux machine. We tested it in Debian 11.

## Quick start

Clone the repo in your preferred folder.
Then add the folder in your bash initialization script. For example.
```bash
# ~/.bashrc

export PATH=$PATH:<your script path>
```

## License

The library is licenced under the commercial-friendly MIT license.
